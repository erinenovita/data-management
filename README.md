This project aims to translate business requirements into data management solutions. It will involve a complete process of extracting, refining and delivering datasets extracted from both structured databases and unstructured data sources. 

From the structured datasets, we would explore the design of databases and exploit the data using SQL. This includes the principles of relational databases, relational mapping and getting into the right business understanding.

From the semi-structured and unstructured data sources, we delved deeper into transforming the dataset into formats that would be ready for further analysis. We would perform both web-crawling and web-scraping of the unstructured data. Ultimately, we would construct a dashboard that would depict several business requirements.
